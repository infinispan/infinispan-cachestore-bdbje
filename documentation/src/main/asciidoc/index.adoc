== Introduction
The `BdbjeCacheStore` is a cache loader implementation based on 
link:$$http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/je/index.html$$[Oracle/Sleepycat's BerkeleyDB Java Edition]. 

WARNING: The BerkeleyDB implementation requires a commercial license if distributed with an application (see link:$$http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/index.html$$[Oracle's website] for details).

== Javadoc
For detailed description of all the parameters supported by this store,
please consult the link:$$http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/$$[javadoc].

== Configuration
This cache store utilizes the file system to store data.
It requires a `location` attribute, which maps to a directory to be used as a persistent store.
(e.g., `location="/tmp/myDataStore"`).
